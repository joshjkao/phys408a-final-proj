    "# Simulating the Physics of Rail Guns\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "From trebuchets to chemical weapons and eventually nuclear bombs, it seems that humans have learned how to weaponize nearly every physical phenomenon there is. It turns out that electromagnetism is no different, with the US Navy recently spending hundreds of millions of dollars on the development of weapons leveraging the magnetic force to launch projectiles at hypersonic speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "These devices exploit the Lorentz Force, the force that a moving charge experiences due to an external magnetic field. The force is described by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "F_{Lorentz} = q \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This information reveals the simplicity of the concept of a rail gun:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](RailGunDiagram.jpg \"Title\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Current flows down the left rail, through the projectile, and up the right rail. The purpose of the parallel rails is to create a strong magnetic field in the space occupied by the projectile. Recall that the magnetic field of a straight wire carrying a current is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\vec{B} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{2\\pi r}(\\vec{I}\\times\\hat{r})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "And that the direction of this field circulates around the wire according to the right hand rule. As is visible in the diagram, the current flowing down the left rail yield a symmetric magnetic field in the region between the rails. The current through the projectile flows to the right while under the influence of a magnetic field that only has an upward component. As described by the Lorentz force described above, this will result in a magnetic force parallel to the rails.\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, that is the extent of the physics that make rail guns possible."

    "## Magnetic Forces on the Projectile\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we analyze the magnetic field created by the current in both parallel rails. This allows us to fully determine the magnetic field acting on the projectile, and thus determine the force acting on the projectile. With further development, this could lead to further analysis of the projectile's acceleration and thus performance. For the purposes of this project, however, we consider a highly simplified model in the magnetostatic case. \n",
    "\n",
    "To model the rails, we consider two long, straight wires of negligible thickness. The projectile is modeled as a third long, straight wire running perpendicular to both. We choose the coordinate axes so that the \"left\" rail carries current in the negative x direction along the x axis, aligned with the origin. The projectile carries current in the positive y direction along the y axis for a the given projectile width. The \"right\" rail carries current in the positive x direction parallel to the \"left\" rail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system's adjustable parameters are declared as global variables which are updated by their corresponding sliders. Functions are defined to use these parameters and return vectors representing the three currents described above."

Since then, the Navy has suspended the development of these devices due to the technological difficulty. There are several challenges that make rail guns impractical, for example the fact that the immense current causes the rails to melt and wear extremely fast. However, a more interesting challenge from the perspective of magnetostatics is the phenomenon of repulsion.\n",

Furthermore, both rails carry high current in stright lines but opposite directions, which also creates a force pushing the rails apart. When combined, the repulsion between the rails is speculated to be a large contributing factor in why the rail gun failed. \n",

    "While the physics driving the rail gun are simple on first glance, simulating them accurately is no easy feat. The visualizations given in this project are based off of highly simplified geometry, so the values produced are really not useful for anything besides comparing to each other. A more accurate simulation of this system would likely have to discretize the current at every point into small moving charges, so that the magnetic field due to each individual current element could be summed up to create a better picture of the actual fields at play. This would require significantly more development and computing time that might not be suitable for interactive plots such as in Jupyter Notebook, but the results would likely be far more accurate."
